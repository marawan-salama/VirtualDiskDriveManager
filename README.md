# VirtualDiskDriveManager
VirtualDiskDriveManager is a basic implementation of a virtual file system using POSIX I/O, designed to operate on a simulated disk drive consisting of 16 logical blocks of 16 bytes each. This project enables users to interact with the virtual disk through a command-line interface, supporting operations such as importing and exporting files between the host and the virtual drive, managing directories (creating, listing, and removing), and displaying raw disk content. The file system has a simple hierarchical structure, with a root directory and unique file and directory naming conventions. VirtualDiskDriveManager is ideal for learning about basic file system operations, I/O management, and virtual disk handling in a POSIX-compatible environment.
